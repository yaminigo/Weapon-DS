#CSCI 572 Final project
Use Apache open source crawling framework to extract data from web related to weapon images and ads.
Main aim was to collect weapon images from web and use collected data to perform all analysis and find spatial and temporal patterns.

Developed de-duplication algorithms to detect exact and near duplicates in the extracted data.

Integrated a robust, content-based de-duplication plugin to the crawling framework and improved the quality of the data crawled.

Employed tika image similarity algorithm to find and visualize image clusters in the crawled data.

Used Apache Solr for indexing data and developed a web interface for interacting and visualizing the indexed data using technologies like angular JS, Jquery and D3.js.
